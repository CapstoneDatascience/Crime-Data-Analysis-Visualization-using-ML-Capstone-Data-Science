# Crime-Data-Analysis-Visualization-using-ML-Capstone-Data-Science
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting crime trends across the United States. Using data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, the project leverages machine learning algorithms, big data processing, and visualization tools to provide insights into crime patterns, hotspots, and risk areas. It also aims to assist law enforcement agencies and communities in making data-driven decisions to enhance public safety.
